# How To use without a GUI

## Setup
First you should edit the values in participant.conf

Note:

- The values to the right of the : should be in quotation marks.
- if you're not in a team, the TeamID should be set to 'null' without quotation marks.

## To run

On Linux you should type:

python3 extralifedonations.py

On Windows it's easiest to open extralifedonations.py in IDLE and then run the script from there. (This avoids any issues with python being in your path)
