ELDonation Tracker is both a Python interface to the `Extra Life Charity`_ API and a reference implementation, including a GUI, that can be used to provide on-screen donation information and updates when streaming a gaming video or recording a gaming video in OBS or XSplit. For a video explaining how to use the GUI reference implementation, visit: http://djotaku.github.io/ELDonationTracker/ . You may also use the API to build your own applications that access the API. The modules are well documented, see the Module Index in the documentation.
