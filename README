To run:

On Linux you should be able to either do ./extrlifedonations.py (although you may need to change the path in the #! line) or 

python3 extralifedonations.py

First you should edit the variables in the section called "variables to change".

Take note that TeamID should be set to None (no quotation marks) if you're not on a team.

If you want a webpage you can use as a GUI to do a sanity check on what should be in the donation files, first change the folder at the end in the __main__ section (this should be the same folder you're using for the text files). Then run

python createHTML.py 

Then open mainpage.html at the folder you told it to use. It should update every 15 seconds.

(Currently web page creation is still python 2)

tracker.html part still needs a little work.

If you want support for other configurations, please open an issue.
