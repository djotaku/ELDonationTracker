To run:

On Linux you should be able to either do ./extrlifedonations.py (although you may need to change the path in the #! line) or 

python3 extralifedonations.py

First you should edit the variables in the section called "variables to change".

Take note that TeamID should be set to None (no quotation marks) if you're not on a team.

(Currently web page creation is still python 3)

If you want support for other configurations, please open an issue.
